SUMMARY:Project requirements
DESCRIPTION:Non-formal. Shown here to give an idea of the basic requirements of the program. I see no point to formalize them into single statement requirements at this time.

<ol>
<li> The program shall support "most" web server configurations without any adaptions, i.e. it shall be written in a standard programming language that exist on most web servers. Project decision: PHP
<li> Installation and configuration must be simple (must take less than 15 minutes). The configuration settings shall be stored in one single PHP class.
<li> Integration of ics-blog to a web site must be possible to do with maximum 5 PHP class and or function calls from an external index file. 
<li> It shall be simple to edit and add entries to the blog. Project decision: Use iCalendar files for data storage. They can be created and edited with almost any calendar program.</ol>

SUMMARY:Current project status
DESCRIPTION:Ics-blog (beta) has been released into the open through its project site <a href="http://www.samoht.se/">samoht.se</a> and SourceForge.net. Current running installations of Ics-blog are <a href="http://www.samoht.se/blog/">the weblog</a> and the <a href="http://www.samoht.se/ics-blog/">ics-blog project web site</a>.

<ul>
<li>Ics-Blog 0.16 adds support for urls spanning several lines in an ics file
<li>Ics-Blog 0.15 redefines the cascading style sheets in order to become more generic and easy to adapt, as well as improving the interfaces and ics file parsing
<li>Ics-Blog 0.14 adds support for showing a subset of the available calendar entries and browsing between them
<li>Ics-Blog 0.13 improves the ics parsing for Gnome Evolution iCalendar files
<li>Ics-Blog 0.12 introduces a more robust parse engine for ics files.
<li>Ics-Blog 0.11 changed the base component used in ics files from VJOURNAL to VEVENT to allow support for more calendar files.
<li>Ics-Blog 0.10 was the first release of ics-blog.
</ul>
